# see if your IP is considered "fucked" by you-know-who search engines

## what?

so, sometimes, due to the stupidity of your ISP (pathetic!) or your VPN provider , you may recieve a forbidden(403)
or unacceptable(406) from a site, as I understand(sort of) , the fault usually lies within your ip 

this mini-script checks the response code to see if big G or some other search engines have blacklisted the ip (whether temporarily or not)

### even more details:

-you are using one of those VPNs that are utilizing a cheap VPS or shared IP(duh), which of course,
you can pay to get one of them juicy dedicated IPs

-your ISP has assigned you a bad IP (usually a shared one, that either is malformed or is abused by
some of other users sharing your IP or that specifice IP is reported to one of those sites that maintain
abusive IPs and accept reports)
** techincally , it's a bit more complicated than that but if you know, than you know **

## why even write this?

no reason really :)

## you know it probably won't work well, don't you?

yea, exactly like life, nothing works well :)
